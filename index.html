    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Katrina Hill and I'm going to tell you a few things about myself as part of this lab project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> I live in Snohomish, WA with my husband and two sons. We really enjoy the weather here.</li>
        <li>I have both a bachelors and Master's degree in Environmental Science.</li>
        <li>I worked for local and state government where my duties included enforcing compliance with applicable local, state, and federal environmental laws.</li>
        <li> Prior to that, I was in the US Navy for five years as a IT Network Administrator.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While I enjoyed the field of environmental protection, I wanted to switch gears and get into software
      development. Software development seems like a really interesting and rewarding career field.</p>
    <p>My goal is to complete the Software Development certification and find a job I enjoy and am proud of.</p>
