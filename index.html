<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Katrina Hill and I'm going to tell you a few things about myself as part of this lab project.  
  I live in Snohomish, WA with my husband and two sons. We really enjoy the weather here.  
  I have both a bachelors and Master's degree in Environmental Science. I worked for local and state government where my duties included enforcing compliance with applicable local, state, and federal environmental laws. Prior to that, I was in the US Navy for five years as a IT Network Administrator.  
  While I enjoyed the field of environmental protection, I wanted to switch gears and get into software development. Software development seems like a really interesting and rewarding career field.  
  My goal is to complete the Software Development certification and find a job I enjoy and am proud of. </p>
