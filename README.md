# About Me

## LAB - 02  

Project Name: About Me  

I am creating this project so everyone can get to know me better. I will include information about my background, education, and goals. I'll also include a guessing game you can play. Fun!!

The guessing game will include prompts with questions about me for you to answer. The first new change you'll be asked is a question that for you to guess a number. I'll let you know when your number is too high or too low. You'll be given four opportunities to guess the correct answer. If you don't get the answer correctly after the fourth try, I'll just tell you the correct answer.  

The next new change will also be a question for which you'll get six opportunities to guess the correct answer. I'll provide you with several possible correct answers to guess from.  

At the end of the guessing game, I'll give you your score so you can see how many correct answers you got out of the seven questions asked.  

Thanks for reading up about me and playing my game.
